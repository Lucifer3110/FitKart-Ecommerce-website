    <h1>Strength vs Endurance</h1><br>
    <p>
    <ul>

        <li>Doing less repetitions with more weight will help you increase your strength. Doing more repetitions with
            lighter weights will help you build up endurance. And the truth is, in the real world, you need both and use
            both in your everyday life.</li> <br>

        <li> Muscle strength is the ability to exert a maximal amount of force for a short period of time. In the gym,
            that may be bench pressing a heavy barbell 5-8 repetitions. Think about lifting that heavy box when moving –
            that requires strength.</li><br>

        <li>Muscle endurance is the ability to do something over and over for an extended period of time without getting
            tired. In the gym, that may be doing 50 body weight squats in a row, moving to a rhythm. Skiing, for
            example, is a sport that uses muscle endurance. When you are going down the slope, bending your knees,
            firing your quads, and swooshing down that hill or mountain for several minutes to even longer you need
            endurance.</li><br>

        <li>While at the gym, you will see a variety of people doing a variety of strength and endurance exercises. When
            teaching a strength class, I always incorporate some exercises that will build muscle strength and some that
            involve muscle endurance to round out the participants training. I do this because as I said above, out in
            the real world, you never know whether you'll need strength or endurance to complete everyday tasks.</li>
        <br>

        <li>And, ignore the myth that using heavy weight will bulk you up. Men genetically can develop more muscle mass
            through heavy lifting. However, women, for the most part, do not have the type of testosterone to create
            that huge muscle bound look. Remember, more muscle is a good thing. The more muscle you have, the more
            calories your body will burn throughout the day and the more capable you are to perform any activity that
            comes your way.</li>
    </ul>
    </p><br>
    <br>
    <h1>How to improve Muscle Endurance</h1><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Cardio training: Cardio is an effective way to improve endurance and build stamina. Unlike weight-lifting,
            cardio needs to be performed for a longer duration. It helps build the body’s lactic acid system, which
            allows the body to sustain muscle contraction for longer.
            <ul>
                <li>Walking</li>
                <li>Running</li>
                <li>Swimming</li>
                <li>jumping Rope</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Local muscular endurance exercises: Muscular endurance exercises that use the body weight and target specific muscles of the body include:
            <ul>
                <li>Squats</li>
                <li>Planks</li>
                <li>Push ups</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul><br><br>
    <h1>Workouts for building strength and endurance : </h1><br>
    <p>While at the gym, you will see a variety of people doing a variety of strength and endurance exercises. Effective strength classes should incorporate some exercises that build muscle strength and some that involve muscle endurance to round out the participants’ training. In the real world, you never know whether you’ll need strength or endurance to complete everyday tasks.<br><br>

        When you plan your own workouts, try to focus on both muscle strength and muscle endurance.<br><br>
        
        Some days it will be good to focus on endurance and use lighter weights going for more repetitions.1﻿ This is often combined with cardio exercises. However, it is crucial that you also spend at least 2 days a week using heavy weights so that after only a few repetitions you are at muscle failure. This not only keeps you strong but boosts your metabolism to run at a higher rate.<br><br>
        
        How? More muscle on your body, more calories you will churn through every single day even at rest.<br><br>
        
        Lastly, using heavy weights will help build strength and increase muscle mass. Men genetically can develop more muscle mass through heavy lifting. However, women, for the most part, do not have the type of testosterone to create that huge muscle-bound look. And having more muscle is a good thing.<br><br>
        
        The more muscle you have, the more calories your body will burn throughout the day and the more strength you will have to perform any activity that comes your way.<br><br></p><br><br>
